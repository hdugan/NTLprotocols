# Ammonia and Nitrate/Nitrite {#sec-alkalinity}

### NITRATE/NITRITE

This automated procedure for the determination of nitrate and nitrite utilizes the procedure whereby nitrate is reduced to nitrite by a copper-cadmium reductor column. The nitrite ion then reacts with sulfanilamide under acidic conditions to form a diazo compound. This compound then couples with N-1-napthylethylenediamine dihydrochloride to form a reddish-purple azo dye.

### AMMONIA

This automated procedure for the determination of ammonia utilizes the Berthelot Reaction, in which the formation of a blue colored compound believed to be closely related to indophenol occurs when the solution of an ammonium salt is added to sodium phenoxide, followed by the addition of sodium hypochlorite. A solution of potassium sodium tartrate and sodium citrate is added to the sample stream to eliminate the precipitation of the hydroxides of calcium and magnesium.
