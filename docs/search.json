However, if the spreadsheet is not available or becomes corrupted, the steps below can be used to calculate alkalinity.\nUse the calibration buffers to calculate a standard curve relating mV (millivolts) to pH. Calculate the slope (mstd) and intercept (bstd).\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this example, the slope (mstd) is -56.44 and the intercept (bstd) is 368.77. The slope should always be negative for the standard curve and the coefficients should be similar to the values in this example. If not, the pH probe may be faulty. Try calibrating.\nUsing the standard curve coefficients, calculate the pH for each point in the sample titration. \\[ pH = {(mV-\\ b_{std})\\over m_{std}} \\]\nThe pH from the sample titration, the initial sample volume (mL), and volume of acid added (mL) are used to calculate F1 for each point in the sample titration. \\[ F1 = 1000 \\times {Volume Acid Added + Sample Volume \\over Sample Volume} \\times 10^{-pH} \\]\nRegress the volume of acid added (mL) versus F1.

The slope should always be positive for this relationship and the R2 value should be >0.98. If not, the pH probe may be faulty, the pipette calibration is incorrect, or the analyst was not careful with pipetting. Try calibrating or reanalysis of the sample.\nCalculate alkalinity (µEg/L) using molarity of the titration acid (nominally 0.05 N, but needs to be determined for each batch), initial sample volume (mL), and \\(b_{F1}\\).\n\\[ Alkalinity ({µEq \\over L}) = {b_{F1} \\times Titrant Molarity \\over Sample Volume} \\times 1e6 \\]"

    "text": "1.5 Preparation of Standards and Reagents\nPreparation of 1000 µEq L-1 standard for alkalinity titration requires sodium carbonate (Na2CO3), 2 L of milliQ water, 2L volumetric flask, and standard solution storage bottles. The mathematical justification for the recipe below (note, there are 2 equivalents of Na+ per mol of Na2CO3):\n\\[ 0.1061 g\\:Na_2CO_3 \\times {1mol\\:Na_2CO_3 \\over 105.99g\\:Na_2CO_3} \\times {1e6\\:µEq \\over Eq} \\times {2Eq \\over mol} \\times {1 \\over 2L} = {1001\\:µEq \\over L}\\]\n\nDry approximately 0.2 g of sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) salt in the drying oven for at least 3 hours prior making the standard\nLabel a 2 L volumetric flask and fill approximately half way with milliQ\nWeigh out 0.1061 g of Na2CO3 salt using a weigh boat and the analytical balance. Add the salt to the volumetric flask with milliQ water (step 5.1.2)\nCap the volumetric flask with parafilm or the glass stopper, and swirl to dissolve and combine.\nFill the volumetric flask to the 2L mark with milliQ water and invert to mix.\nDispense the standard solution into the clean and labeled standard storage solution bottles. NOTE: the label should include the chemical composition, date of preparation, and preparer’s initials.\n\nPreparing 0.05 M HCl titration solution for alkalinity titration requires Fisher Brand Optima HCl, milliQ water, and a 1 L volumetric flask. Note, that for this solution, molarity is equivalent to normality because there is 1 H+ per Cl-. The mathematical justification for the recipe below:\nFor 100 g of solution, there will be 34 g of HCl, therefore: \\[ 34g\\:HCl \\times {1mol\\:HCl \\over 36.4611g\\:HCl} = 0.9325mol\\:HCl\\]\nThe specific gravity (density) of HCl is 1.18 g/mL: \\[ 100g\\:solution \\times {1mL\\:solution \\over 1.18g \\:HCl} \\times {1L\\:solution \\over 1000mL} = 0.0847L\\:solution\\]\n\\[{0.9325mol\\:HCl \\over 0.0847L\\:solution} = 11.01M\\:(mols/L)\\]\nBased upon M1V1 = M2V2: \\[V1 = {{0.05\\:HCl \\times 1000mL}\\over 11.01M} = 4.54 mL\\]\n\nFill the volumetric flask with ~800 mL of milliQ water.\nUsing a pipette, dispense 4.54 mL of HCl into the volumetric flask\nFill the volumetric flask to the 1 L mark with milliQ water. Cap and invert to mix.\n\nStandardizing the HCl titration solution requires titrating the 1000 µEq/L standard multiple times and the intercept of F1 ~ volume of acid added (step 4.4, above) is averaged to determine molarity.\n\nFollowing the methods in Part 2 of this protocol, titrate at least 10 standard solution samples of 16 mL.\nEnter the data into the calculation spreadsheet (based on calculations in Part 4 of this protocol) and record the intercept.\nAverage the intercepts from the 10 titrations of standard solution and use in the following equation to calculate molarity (equivalent in this case to normality): \\[{1000 \\over 1e6} \\times {16mL \\over avg.intercept} = molarity\\:of\\:HCl\\:solution\\]"
