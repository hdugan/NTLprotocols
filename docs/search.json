This will be the working acid solution you use for titrations and pre-dosing.\n\n\n1.2.5 Pre-dose the standard sample with 0.2-0.4 mL of 0.5 N HCl acid. Remember, 100 µL = 0.1 mL\n\n\n1.2.6 Place the standard sample on the stir plate and carefully position the pH probe so that is submerged in the sample without touching the sides or the microstir bar. Turn on the stir plate.\n\n\n1.2.7 Using the electronic micropipette, add 0.01 mL aliquots of HCl until the meter reads 120 mV. Keep track of the volume added!\n\n1.2.7.1 Record the pre-dosing volume and volume added in the following step along with the mV reading on line 1.\n\n\n1.2.7.2 Do not record any readings or volumes until the mV reading is greater than 120 mV.\n\n\n\n1.2.8 Add an additional 0.01 mL aliquot of acid to the standard sample and let the pH reading stabilize. Record the new volume and mV.\n\n\n1.2.9 Repeat this process for 10 total aliquots of 0.01 mL of acid.

If the standard samples are wildly different from each other, the pH probe or the standard solution may be compromised. Do not continue with sample analysis in this instance and seek guidance from the Lab Manager."

    "text": "1.4 Calculations\nThere is a calculation spreadsheet available on the shared drive. However, if the spreadsheet is not available or becomes corrupted, the steps below can be used to calculate alkalinity.\n\n1.4.1 Use the calibration buffers to calculate a standard curve relating mV (millivolts) to pH. Calculate the slope (mstd) and intercept (bstd).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this example, the slope (mstd) is -56.44 and the intercept (bstd) is 368.8. The slope should always be negative for the standard curve and the coefficients should be similar to the values in this example. If not, the pH probe may be faulty. Try calibrating.\n\n\n1.4.2 Using the standard curve coefficients, calculate the pH for each point in the sample titration. \\[ pH = {(mV-\\ b_{std})\\over m_{std}} \\]\n\n\n1.4.3 The pH from the sample titration, the initial sample volume (mL), and volume of acid added (mL) are used to calculate F1 for each point in the sample titration. \\[ F1 = 1000 \\times {Volume Acid Added + Sample Volume \\over Sample Volume} \\times 10^{-pH} \\]\n\n\n1.4.4 Regress the volume of acid added (mL) versus F1. The intercept (bF1) of this regression (mL) will be used to calculate alkalinity.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this example, the intercept (bF1) is 0.3177. The slope should always be positive for this relationship and the R2 value should be >0.98. If not, the pH probe may be faulty, the pipette calibration is incorrect, or the analyst was not careful with pipetting. Try calibrating or reanalysis of the sample.\n\n\n1.4.5 Calculate alkalinity (µEg/L) using molarity of the titration acid (nominally 0.05 N, but needs to be determined for each batch), initial sample volume (mL), and \\(b_{F1}\\).\n\\[ Alkalinity ({µEq \\over L}) = {b_{F1} \\times Titrant Molarity \\over Sample Volume} \\times 1e6 \\]"

    "text": "1.5 Preparation of Standards and Reagents\n\n1.5.1 Preparation of 1000 µEq L-1 standard for alkalinity titration\nRequires sodium carbonate (Na2CO3), 2 L of milliQ water, 2L volumetric flask, and standard solution storage bottles. The mathematical justification for the recipe below (note, there are 2 equivalents of Na+ per mol of Na2CO3):\n\\[ 0.1061 g\\:Na_2CO_3 \\times {1mol\\:Na_2CO_3 \\over 105.99g\\:Na_2CO_3} \\times {1e6\\:µEq \\over Eq} \\times {2Eq \\over mol} \\times {1 \\over 2L} = {1001\\:µEq \\over L}\\]\n\n1.5.1.1 Dry approximately 0.2 g of sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) salt in the drying oven for at least 3 hours prior making the standard\n\n\n1.5.1.2 Label a 2 L volumetric flask and fill approximately half way with milliQ\n\n\n1.5.1.3 Weigh out 0.1061 g of Na2CO3 salt using a weigh boat and the analytical balance. Add the salt to the volumetric flask with milliQ water (previous step)\n\n\n1.5.1.4 Cap the volumetric flask with parafilm or the glass stopper, and swirl to dissolve and combine.\n\n\n1.5.1.5 Fill the volumetric flask to the 2L mark with milliQ water and invert to mix.\n\n\n1.5.1.6 Dispense the standard solution into the clean and labeled standard storage solution bottles. NOTE: the label should include the chemical composition, date of preparation, and preparer’s initials.\n\n\n\n1.5.2 Preparing 0.05 M HCl titration solution or alkalinity titration\nRequires Fisher Brand Optima HCl, milliQ water, and a 1 L volumetric flask. Note, that for this solution, molarity is equivalent to normality because there is 1 H+ per Cl-. The mathematical justification for the recipe below:\nFor 100 g of solution, there will be 34 g of HCl, therefore: \\[ 34g\\:HCl \\times {1mol\\:HCl \\over 36.4611g\\:HCl} = 0.9325mol\\:HCl\\]\nThe specific gravity (density) of HCl is 1.18 g/mL: \\[ 100g\\:solution \\times {1mL\\:solution \\over 1.18g \\:HCl} \\times {1L\\:solution \\over 1000mL} = 0.0847L\\:solution\\]\n\\[{0.9325mol\\:HCl \\over 0.0847L\\:solution} = 11.01M\\:(mols/L)\\]\nBased upon M1V1 = M2V2: \\[V1 = {{0.05\\:HCl \\times 1000mL}\\over 11.01M} = 4.54 mL\\]\n\n1.5.2.1 Fill the volumetric flask with ~800 mL of milliQ water.\n\n\n1.5.2.2 Using a pipette, dispense 4.54 mL of HCl into the volumetric flask\n\n\n1.5.2.3 Fill the volumetric flask to the 1 L mark with milliQ water. Cap and invert to mix.\n\n\n\n1.5.3 Standardizing the HCl titration solution\nRequires titrating the 1000 µEq L-1 standard multiple times and the intercept of F1 ~ volume of acid added (Section 1.4.4) is averaged to determine molarity.\n\n1.5.3.1 Following the methods in Part 2 of this protocol, titrate at least 10 standard solution samples of 16 mL.\n\n\n1.5.3.2 Enter the data into the calculation spreadsheet (based on calculations in Section 1.4 of this protocol) and record the intercept.\n\n\n1.5.3.3 Average the intercepts from the 10 titrations of standard solution and use in the following equation to calculate molarity (equivalent in this case to normality): \\[{1000 \\over 1e6} \\times {16mL \\over avg.intercept} = molarity\\:of\\:HCl\\:solution\\]"
