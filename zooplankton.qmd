# Zooplankton {#sec-zooplankton}

Revised: April 2024, Paul Schramm

### Purpose:

We collect zooplankton samples at the deepest part of the lake using two different gear types. We take one vertical tow with a Wisconsin Net (80um mesh), and a series of Schindler Patalas (53um mesh) samples spanning the water column. All samples are preserved in cold 95% EtOH.

After collection we combine subsamples of the individual Schindler Patalas trap samples to create one hypsometrically pooled sample for each lake/date. The individual depth samples are discarded after pooling except from one August sampling date per year. The Hypsometrically Pooled sample and the Wisconsin Net sample are archived in the UW Zoology museum.

We count zooplankton in one or two subsamples, each representing 1.8L of lake water, of the hypsometrically pooled samples to calculate zooplankton abundance. We count one sample date per month from the open water season, and the February ice cover sample. We identify individuals to genus or species, take length measurements, and count eggs and embryos.

##### Target Depths:

From the field, there will be 1 Wisconsin net sample per lake, and multiple Schindler Trap samples from the following depths:

-   TR: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 15, 20, 27, 31 meters
-   CR/BM: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 18 meters
-   SP: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17 meters
-   AL/TB: 1, 3, 6 meters
-   CB: 1 meter

With the exception of CB, the goal is to create a hypsometrically pooled sample for each lake.

Take samples starting at the surface and working down. Lower the trap slowly so that it remains vertical in the water. Pause at the target depth long enough to allow both trap doors to close completely, and check when it reaches the surface that both did close. Drain the trap through the net and cup, swirling the cup until the liquid level is below the mesh windows. Remove the cup from the net and pull out the center pin to drain the sample into jar, then rinse cup and pin several times with 95% EtOH into the sample jar.

### Northern Highlands Lake District:

##### Jar Preparation

Label 4-oz jars with computer printed labels for Wisconsin net and hypsometrically pooled samples. Add the date to the label using a soft pencil (#1 pencil). Cover the labels with a strip of clear contact paper, making sure the contact paper completely covers the label and encircles the jar. Weigh the empty jars, including lids, on the Mettler XS603S balance. Record these weights on the ‘Volume by Weight’ data sheet.

Add 80 ml chilled 95% EtOH to the Wisconsin net and field collection jars (120mL glass screw top jars); leave the HP jar empty.  Keep the zooplankton jars cold until sample collection.


##### Sample Collection: Schindler-Patalas Trap

Use the 2-meter high, 45L Schindler-Patalas trap with 53um mesh net and cup. The volume of the trap used should be indicated on the Volume by Weight form.

Collect samples from the target depths at the deep sampling station in each lake. Sample depths are measured from the middle of the trap.

#### Sample Collection: Wisconsin Net

Lower the net to the bottom sample depth. Pull it up slowly, at a rate of about 3 seconds per meter. A slow haul prevents the net from pushing water and plankton away from the mouth of the net. Drain the cup until the water level is below the lower window, then pour contents into the sample jar. Rinse the cup with 95% EtOH several times, adding the rinse to the sample jar.


##### Hypsometric Pooling Rationale and Definition

In March 1986 the LTER Zooplankton Group decided to pool the discrete depth Schindler Patalas trap samples into one pooled sample per lake-date for counting. Counting pooled samples rather than all of the depth samples reduces the time to produce zooplankton count data. The group hoped to count pooled samples from the entire backlog of uncounted samples and eventually to count samples shortly after collection.

Samples are pooled considering lake hypsometry and, therefore, represent the entire lake. Previously, unpooled samples (2-9 samples per lake-date) or samples pooled considering only a water column were counted. Hypsometric pooling allows us to consider the zooplankton community as representing the entire lake, as our other limnological methods do, instead of just a column of water.

Lake hypsometry is a three dimensional image of a lake or basin. In a simplified example of hypsometry, a lake is similar to a cone filled with water. If the cone were divided into three layers by two equidistant horizontal planes, the volumes in those layers would be very different from each other. The uppermost layer would contain the most water. Similarly, the upper depths typically contain most of the volume of a lake.

Pooling is the creation of a new sample from subsamples of the Schindler trap samples collected from one lake-date. The volume of each subsample used to make the pooled sample reflects the depth range the sample represents and the volume of water that range represents relative to the entire lake volume. Samples pooled in this manner are called HP samples, for "hypsometrically pooled", and are referred to as "volume weighted" because the volume of lake water each depth sample represents determines the subsample size.

In sum, the advantages to this method of pooling are quicker turnover time and representation of the entire lake in a volume weighted fashion. Disadvantages of this method include the time required to pool subsamples, errors introduced during pooling, and the loss of more specific depth information.

##### Pooling Procedure

Weigh the Wisconsin Net sample and record the weight on the Volume by Weight form. Mark the liquid level on the jar with a 'Sharpee' brand permanent marker, be sure the mark is not above label or it will bleed onto label. Write the sample date on the cap.

Add 95% EtOH to each Schindler trap sample to bring liquid volume up to a weight of 105g. Note that weights always include the lid. If sample jars already contain more than 105g of liquid, allow some of the volume to evaporate in the hood, and then bring up to 105g. Record the final weight of jar + sample + EtOH on the Volume by Weight form.

If the samples were collected at target depths, the pooling volumes are already calculated and listed on the Vol. by Wt forms (also see calculations below in Appendix). Otherwise, calculate the subsample volumes, called 'target' volumes, using the hypsometric table for each lake.

Mix the first sample gently and thoroughly by tilting the jar from side to side. Measure the target volume into a plastic graduated cylinder. Do not use glass. Pour the subsample quickly and smoothly because plankton settle out quite rapidly. Choose the smallest size graduated cylinder that can measure the target volume in one aliquot. Add the subsample to the labeled HP (hypsometrically pooled) jar. Repeat with all other depth samples. When all the subsamples have been added to the HP sample, rinse each graduated cylinder into the HP jar with several small volumes of EtOH. Printable lab instructions can be found in appendix 1.

Place the HP sample in the hood to evaporate the excess volume of rinse EtOH. The final weight of the HP sample should be 105g. Mark the liquid level on the jar with a Sharpee brand permanent marker, and write the sample date on the cap and with the letters "HP". If the samples are from the August quarterly, pour the remainder of each Schindler sample into a labeled jar for archival. For all other sample dates, discard what is left of the Schindler samples. Rinse the field sample jars with RO water and allow to air dry.

#### Sample Storage and Record Keeping

The following samples are archived from each sampling trip: Hyposmetrically pooled sample and Wisconsin Net sample in 120 ml glass jars. Depth samples are archived from the August quarterly sampling in 120 ml glass jars. Store samples in cardboard records boxes (15"x 12"x 4.5"), storing samples from each lake in a separate box. Approximately one year of samples will fit in one box. Fill out the forms for each sample and sample box, as noted below. Box Inventory Form: A record of box contents. It remains in the sample storage box.

Volume by Weight Form: A record of samples collected for any one lake-date and their volumes, storage box number, and history of sample usage. Filed in 3-ring binders. When full, these binders are sent to the LTER data manager. When boxes become full, check the contents against the Inventory Form and Volume by Weight forms. LTER samples and related paperwork are eventually transferred to the Zoology Museum at UW-Madison via the Museum Committee.

#### Zooplankton Counting

Zooplankton counting is performed on hypsometrically pooled samples.

Bring sample up to last volume listed on Volume by Weight sheet with EtOH (this accounts for any potential evaporation). Note that sample weights include cap.

Thoroughly mix the sample by inverting the jar gently many times. Remove subsamples with Henson-Stempel pipet, dispensing into a mesh bottomed cup. Rinse the subsample into a Bogorov counting tray with RO water. Add a few drops of soap solution to the tray to reduce surface tension. Count copepods and cladocerans, then stain subsample with lugols and count rotifers and nauplii. Count two 5 ml subsamples for copepods and cladocerans. Count one 5 ml subsample for rotifers and nauplii. If there are fewer than 100 of the most numerous rotifer species in 5 ml, count a second 5ml subsample for rotifers and nauplii. Count all eggs attached to any species. Count individuals floating on the surface as well as those on the bottom of the counting tray. Do not return the subsamples to the jar after counting. In cases where there are very large numbers of rotifers, or where there is so much algae that the rotifers are obscured, count one or more smaller (2ml) subsamples for rotifers and nauplii.

Use the automated Z3 counting program to count and measure. Measure 10 individuals of each copepod species/stage, and 20 individuals of each cladoceran species. Measurements as follows: Measure copepods from the tip of the head to the end of the urosome, excluding the caudal rami. Measure cladocerans from the tip of the head to the posterior of the carapace, excluding tailspine. However, measure helmeted Daphnia species from the anterior edge of the eye capsule to the posterior of the carapace.  Rotifers are not routinely measured.

When finished, mark the new liquid level on the jar with a permanent marker. Weigh jar and record weight in a new column of the V by Wt sheet. Return sample jar to storage box.

#### Protocol log:

-   1981 -- May1984 -- a 0.5m high, 31L Schindler Patalas trap with 80um mesh net was used. Two Wisconsin Net tows were collected. Preservative was 12% buffered formalin.
-   June1984 -- changed to 53um mesh net on Schindler trap.
-   July 1986 -- began using the 2m high, 45L Schindler Patalas trap. Changed WI Net collection to take only one tow.
-   2001 -- changed zooplankton preservative from 12% buffered formalin to 95% EtOH.
-   The number of sample dates per year counted varies with lake and year, from 5 dates/year to 17 dates/year.
-   1981-1983 -- pooled samples are of several types: Total Pooled (TP) were created using equal volume subsamples of the Schindler samples. Epi, Meta, Hypo pooled used equal volume subsamples from the Schindler samples collected from each of the thermal strata. Strata Pooled used equal volume subsamples from the Epi, Meta, Hypo pooled samples to create an entire lake sample. Hypsometrically Pooled (HP) is our standard, which uses subsample volumes weighted to represent the hypsometry of the lake.
